Blender projects, tests and try-outs
====================================

This repository holds the sources for my different [Blender][1]
projects. I try to make them self contained, not needing anything
besides the Blender program, and in case I'm missing anything please let
me know. I will try to document the idea inside the individual project
folders.

A lot of these projects has been rendered and put on my [Vimeo][2]
account.
